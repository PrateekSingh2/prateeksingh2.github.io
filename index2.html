 simultaneously, linking coding and non-coding genetic variants to gene expression in the same single cell.<br/>By: Yuvraj Singh</div>
        <section>
          <h2>By examining genomic variation more closely, scientists can now identify new disease connections 
with greater speed and accuracy.</h2>
          <p>
             For centuries, scientists have recognized that certain illnesses can run in families, an idea that dates back to 
Hippocrates. Over time, researchers have become increasingly skilled at uncovering how these inherited 
patterns are rooted in our genetic makeup.<br/><br/>

Now, researchers at EMBL and their collaborators have introduced a powerful new tool that advances single
cell technology by examining both genomic variations and RNA within the same cell. This approach delivers 
greater accuracy and scalability than earlier methods.<br/><br/>

By detecting changes in the non-coding regions of DNA - areas where disease-related variations most often 
occur - the tool opens new possibilities for exploring how genetic differences influence health. With its ability 
to analyze large numbers of single cells in detail, this innovation marks a major step forward in connecting 
genetic variants to specific diseases.<br/><br/>

‚ÄúThis has been a long-standing problem, as current single-cell methods to study DNA and RNA in the same cell 
have had limited throughput, lacked sensitivity, and are complicated,‚Äù said Dominik Lindenhofer, the lead 
author on a new paper about SDR-Seq published in Nature Methods and a postdoctoral fellow in EMBL's 
Steinmetz Group. ‚ÄúOn a single-cell level, you could read out variants in thousands of cells, but only if they had 
been expressed - so only from coded regions. Our tool works, irrespective of where variants are located, 
yielding single-cell numbers that enable analysis of complex samples.‚Äù

The important difference between coding and non-coding regions<br/>

The genome, which is made up of DNA, has both coding and non-coding parts. Genes in coding regions have 
been compared to instruction manuals or recipes, since those genes are expressed into RNA, essentially telling 
the cell how to make proteins, the building blocks of life.<br/><br/>

Non-coding sections contain many regulatory elements important to cellular development and function. More 
than 95% of disease-associated variants that occur in DNA do so in these non-coding regions, yet current 
single-cell tools haven't provided the throughput and sensitivity to understand these large regions better. Up to 
now, scientists couldn't simultaneously observe DNA and RNA from the same cell at scale to determine DNA 
code variant's functions and their consequences.<br/><br/>

‚ÄúIn this non-coding space, we know there are variants related to things like congenital heart disease, autism, 
and schizophrenia that are vastly unexplored, but these are certainly not the only diseases like this,‚Äù 
Lindenhofer said. ‚ÄúWe needed a tool to do that exploration to understand which variants are functional in their 
endogenous genomic context and understand how they contribute to disease progression.‚Äù

          <h2>Deciphering barcodes that trace single cells</h2>
          <p>
            For single-cell DNA-RNA sequencing (SDR-seq), the scientists employed oil-water emulsion droplets, with each 
drop containing a single cell, to analyze both DNA and RNA. The scientists could actually study thousands of 
cells simultaneously in a given test tube and directly connect genetic changes to gene activity. But this kind of 
technology development required overcoming several limitations and ended up involving collaborators from 
EMBL's Genome Biology and Structural and Computational Biology units, the Stanford University School of 
Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital.<br/><br/>

Initially, collaborators from the EMBL research groups of Judith Zaugg and Kyung-Min Noh developed a way to 
"fix" cells to protect fragile RNA. Additionally, computational biologists from Oliver Stegle's EMBL research group 
built a customized tool to deconvolute and decode the complex DNA barcoding system needed to build this 
technology and enable further downstream data analysis. And though this decoder was built for this project 
specifically, the scientists expect it can be applied to other research.<br/><br/>

Researchers from Wolfgang Huber's and Sasha Dietrich's research groups at EMBL and Universit√§tsklinikum 
Heidelberg, respectively, were already screening B-cell lymphoma cells for other research projects. 
Consequently, they provided primary patient samples with high numbers of genomic variants to help test the 
tool. Lindenhofer then used these samples to observe connections between variants and disease. He found 
that cancer cells with more variants had increased activated signals that helped cancer grow.
 ‚ÄúWe are using these small reaction chambers to read out DNA and RNA in the same single cell,‚Äù Lindenhofer 
said. ‚ÄúThis lets us accurately tell whether a variant is on one or both copies of a gene and measure its effects 
on gene expression in the same single cells. With the B-cell lymphoma cells, we were able to show that 
depending on the variant makeup of cells, they had different propensities to belong to distinct cellular states. 
We could also see that increasing variants in a cell actually were associated with a more malignant B-cell 
lymphoma state.‚Äù

          <h2>The many opportunities from a single cell sequencing tool</h2>
          <p>
             The SDR-seq tool now offers genomic biologists scale, precision, and speed to help better understand genetic 
variants. While it could eventually play a role in treating a broad range of complex diseases, it may first help in 
developing better screening tools for diagnosis.<br/><br/>

‚ÄúWe have a tool that can link variants to disease,‚Äù said Lars Steinmetz, a senior author on the paper, an EMBL 
group leader, and a genetics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. ‚ÄúThis capability opens up a 
wide range of biology that we can now discover. If we can discern how variants actually regulate disease and 
understand that disease process better, it means we have a better opportunity to intervene and treat it.‚Äù<br/><br/>
